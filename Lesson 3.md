Now that I've generally gone through how a `for` loop, I can take a look at other loops and how they work. A `while` loop, which can take the place of a `for` loop, is much more specific than a while loop but can be made to the same thing.

From the last lesson, we created the `for` loop below to print out our list of movies:

```
>>> for each_item in movies:
    print(each_item)

Monty Python and the Holy Grail
1975
Life of Pi
2012
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
2005
```

Now, we can create a `while` loop to do the same thing
