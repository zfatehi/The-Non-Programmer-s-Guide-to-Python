# THE NON-PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE TO PYTHON

Hi everyone. I’m Zahra, just a girl who’s wanted to be able to code for ages. You should be here if you want to join along on my journey. I am by no means experienced; in fact I barely know anything about the world of coding. I am writing this book as I learn, which is pretty unusual. There’s no order to this book really; I am taking concepts from the HeadFirst Python book and building on them through curiosity, mistakes and my dad’s helpful nudges in the right direction. I hope you’re here to learn from my errors and get excited with me when I do something right. Thanks for reading, and enjoy!
